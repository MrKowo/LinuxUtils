# LinuxUtils
A collection of simple but useful linux tools. Most come with a Text-based User Interface.

## Scripts
### Grub Tidy
Interactive Bash script that automates the simplification of GRUB boot menu titles for Linux distributions using the Boot Loader Specification (BLS). It distinguishes Rescue entries from standard kernels and automatically regenerates the GRUB config.

### Auto KBL
Automatic keyboard layout switcher for GNOME. Allows you to assign specific keyboard layouts to specific physical keyboards. When you start typing on a specific device, the system automatically switches to the layout you assigned to it.
